AI practitioners\\neither face challenges in making ethical choices when designing\\nAI-based systems or are not aware of such challenges in the ﬁrst\\nplace. Increasing the level of awareness and understanding of\\nthe perceptions of those who develop AI systems is a critical step\\ntoward mitigating ethical issues in AI development. Motivated\\nby these challenges, needs, and the lack of engaging approaches\\nto address these, we developed an interactive, scenario-based\\nethical AI quiz. It allows AI practitioners, including software\\nengineers who develop AI systems, to self-assess their awareness\\nand perceptions about AI ethics. The experience of taking the\\nquiz, and the feedback it provides, will help AI practitioners\\nunderstand the gap areas, and improve their overall ethical\\npractice in everyday development scenarios. T o demonstrate these\\nexpected outcomes and the relevance of our tool, we also share\\na preliminary user study. The video demo can be found at\\nhttps://zenodo.org/record/7601169#.Y9xgA-xBxhF.\\nIndex T erms—ethics, AI ethics, AI practitioners, self-\\nassessment tools, ethical AI quiz\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\nWith the increased use of AI in different domains such\\nas health, education, transport, and banking, there is also a\\nrise in the number of associated ethical issues. For example,\\nGoogle’s machine learning (ML) algorithms turned out to be\\ngender-biased, associating men with Science, Technology, En-\\ngineering, and Mathematics (STEM) careers more frequently\\nthan women [20]. While GitHub’s unauthorised and unlicensed\\nuse of copyrighted source code as training data for their ML-\\npoweredGitHub Copilotis an example of a privacy issue [1].\\nResearch shows that people involved in the design and\\ndevelopment of AI-based systems, such as AI developers, AI\\nexperts, AI scientists, and AI engineers – collectively referred\\nto as AI practitioners – use various strategies to enhance\\nthe implementation of ethics and ethical principles during the\\ndevelopment of AI-based systems [4], [5], [6]. For example,\\nto create transparency, AI practitioners use strategies such as\\nconducting audits[2] and code documentation[7]. Speculat-\\ning on socio-ethical impacts[3], and group discussionwith\\ncolleagues [4] are other strategies to improve the awareness\\nof ethical issues. Although several tools are available in the\\nmarket, such asDeon[9], AI Fairness 360[10], Fairlearn[11],\\nthere is little information on their practical use. Regardless,\\nAI practitioners continue to face challenges in making ethical\\nchoices on a daily basis [5].\\nIt is essential to understand AI practitioners’ viewpoints\\n[2], awareness [2], [6], and perception [5], [8] of AI ethics,\\nto mitigate ethical issues. Ethical AI education and training\\naims to address this need [21]. However, traditional classroom-\\nbased and didactic approaches typically lack engagement and\\ncan be ineffective [19]. These aspects, along with the current\\nlack of support for AI practitioners to self-assess, motivated us\\nto design and develop an interactiveethical AI quiz1, to allow\\nAI practitioners to self-assess their awareness, understanding,\\nand perceptions of AI ethics and ethical principles. In this\\npaper, we share the details of thequiz design and develop-\\nment, a limited trial with software engineering students, and\\nimplications for practice.\\nII.

E THICAL AI QUIZ –D ESIGN\\nWe aimed to develop an interactiveethical AI quizin the\\nform of a web application to help AI practitioners self-assess\\ntheir knowledge of AI ethics and ethical principles. In taking\\nthe quiz, AI practitioners face a set of 4 scenarios with 3-\\n4 questions each (13 in total) that present ethical dilemmas\\nto varying degrees. Users of the quiz can select from four\\nanswer options for each question. The quiz includes aResult\\nSummary page at the end that enables AI practitioners to\\nview their overall results. The tool also lets participants view\\nthe summary of the result for each question and receive\\nfeedback. The key research and design challenges we faced\\nin designing the quiz included: drafting the quiz content\\n(scenarios, questions, and answer options); coming up with\\na meaningful scoring and feedback system; and designing an\\nappealing UI design and engaging experience, as presented\\nbelow.\\nA. Quiz Content\\nOur primary focus in the initial design phase was brain-\\nstorming the potential quiz questions and ﬁnalising the con-\\ntents of the quiz. We decided that our quiz would consist\\nof scenario-based questions that pose hypothetical events\\ninvolving AI ethics, and users must select answers that best\\nﬁt their ethical values. Scenario-based questions are the best\\nto ask, as they are more engaging and can help stimulate\\na person’s thought and decision-making process [12]. Two\\nof the four scenarios were designed based on real-world\\n1Ethical AI Quiz: https://interactive-ai-ethics-quiz.herokuapp.com/\\n112\\n2023 IEEE/ACM 45th International Conference on Software Engineering: Companion Proceedings (ICSE-Companion)\\n979-8-3503-2263-7/23/$31.00 ©2023 IEEE\\nDOI 10.1109/ICSE-Companion58688.2023.00036\\n2023 IEEE/ACM 45th International Conference on Software Engineering: Companion Proceedings (ICSE-Companion) | 979-8-3503-2263-7/23/$31.00 ©2023 IEEE | DOI: 10.1109/ICSE-COMPANION58688.2023.00036\\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University Bern.

The main aim of a DSRM is to develop\\nknowledge and apply it to designing effective artifacts [18].\\nCare was taken to use language that was unbiased and non-\\nleading. Developing the scenarios, questions, and answers\\ninvolved brainstorming among the team members (six students\\nand four supervisors). Sinceethics is a topic with multiple\\ngrey areas and interpretations, the team carefully modeled\\nthe scenarios, questions, and answer options through multiple\\nrounds of brainstorming and referencing real-life scenarios.\\nAfter multiple rounds of discussions, reviews, and revisions,\\nwe ﬁnalised the quiz scenarios, questions, and answer options.\\nWe referred toAustralia’s AI ethics principles[13] to create\\nour quiz content because our primary focus is to evaluate\\nthe quiz with AI practitioners based in Australia. Initially, we\\nplanned to develop the quiz scenarios and questions based on\\nall eight ethical principles. However, we decided to focus only\\non four ethical principles: accountability, fairness, privacy, and\\nhuman, societal & environmental well-being because of two\\nreasons: (i) we did not want to clutter thequiz with too many\\nscenarios and questions, and (ii) it was challenging to design\\nthe scenarios and quiz questions based on other principles, an\\naspect we aim to explore in future studies. All scenarios and\\nquestions are available on the free onlinequiz.\\nThe questions allow AI practitioners to self-assess their\\nawareness, perceptions, and understanding of AI ethics. By\\nresponding to scenarios posing ethical dilemmas, the quiz can\\ntest the AI practitioner’s knowledge and application of ethical\\nprinciples. Additionally, the quiz can help reveal if there are\\ncertain biases for particular ethical principles present across\\nthe industry.\\nB. Scoring and Feedback\\nWe wanted to maintain an interactive and ‘quiz-like’ feel, so\\nthe users can engage in the process. We also wanted to provide\\nAI practitioners with feedback on their answer choices so they\\ncan learn about AI ethics through the process of taking the\\nquiz. We designed a scoring system to achieve the ﬁrst and\\na feedback system to achieve the second point. The answer\\noptions were designed to be sufﬁciently nuanced to avoid clear\\nright and wrong answers. After much deliberation, we settled\\non ‘least desirable’, ‘bearable’, ‘less than ideal’, and ‘ideal’,\\nwith a score of 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The ﬁnal score\\nis obtained by adding each question’s score, and the overall\\nfeedback is provided based on the ﬁnal score. The score is\\nnot visible to the users, but the feedback is made available\\nat the end of the quiz. The results are stored in the database,\\nwhere further processing can be performed. Table I describes\\nthe overall feedback provided to users based on their scores.\\nAdditionally, they receive feedback for each question and can\\nview the answer they selected and the ideal answer for each\\nquestion. Users can review how they did for each question as\\nthe justiﬁcation for the correct answer is explained to boost\\nexperiential learning (see Fig. 2).\\nTABLE I\\nSCORES AND FEEDBACK OF THE QUIZ\\nScore Feedback\\n76-100% Excellent attempt. Congratulations! Y ou are an AI ethics\\nexpert.\\n51-75% V ery good attempt. Y ou are on track to becoming an AI\\nethics expert.\\n26-50% Satisfactory attempt. With little more knowledge, you can\\nbecome an AI ethics expert.\\n0-25% Unsatisfactory attempt. There is much room for improve-\\nment.\\nIf users want to participate in a future study, they can choose\\nto share their emails, through a text box at the bottom of the\\nresult page, to set up an interview with the research team. In\\nthe interview, they can share their thoughts and opinions on\\nethics and their personal experiences with the researchers.\\nC.

Interface and Engagement\\nAnother important aspect of our design process involved\\nresearching modern user interface (UI) and user experience\\n(UX) approaches. For the ﬁrst step in our UX research,\\nwe looked at the different design principles available to us.\\nSpeciﬁcally, we explored and incorporated these three design\\nprinciples into our web design: Norman’s Design Principles\\n[14], Schneiderman’s 8 Golden Rules of Design [15], and Fitt’s\\nLaw [16]. To integrate accessibility into our design, we also\\nfollowed the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)\\n2.0 [17] to ensure usability for diverse users. These design\\nprinciples and guidelines played a vital role in developing\\nour quiz as they focused on providing a positive experience\\nto users when taking the quiz. For the design of the quiz\\ninterface, a series of wireframes of each screen highlighting\\ndifferent design principles were fabricated by the students and\\nreviewed by the supervisory team. Continuous and iterative\\nfeedback from the supervisory team led to the reﬁnement and\\nreview of each wireframe before reaching a consensus on the\\nﬁnal wireframe design. We discussed the design considerations\\nregarding the placement of scenarios, questions, and answer\\noptions and what images and background themes should be\\nincorporated to make thequiz look aesthetically pleasing and\\nengaging for users. Figure 1 shows the ﬁnal wireframe design\\nalong with an example of one of the scenarios used.\\nThe ﬂow of thequiz starts with a friendly and minimalist\\nhome page prompting users to read the explanatory statement.\\nOnce accepted, the user is redirected to the scenario and quiz\\nquestions, where each question takes up the entire screen\\nto enhance readability. The user receives feedback on their\\noverall performance upon completing thequiz and can access\\nfeedback on individual answers.\\nIII.

Upon getting ethics approval, we requested the unit\\ncoordinators to post the quiz link on the unit forum. The\\nparticipation from the students was completely voluntary. We\\ngathered a total of 50 responses from students. We exported\\nthe data from the database in the .csv ﬁle format and analysed\\nthe data.\\nB. Evaluation results\\n1) Overall results: According to the results, only 20% of\\nthe participants scored between 76%-100% whereas 76% of\\nthe participants scored between 51%-75%. It was worth noting\\nthat only 4% of the participants scored between 26%-50%, and\\nnone scored below 25%, indicating a basic understanding of\\nethical AI principles.\\n2) Results based on ethical principles:The results show\\nthat questions related to ethical principles like‘privacy’ and\\n‘human, societal, and environmental well-being’had the high-\\nest number of ‘ideal’ answers i.e. 35.33% for each ethical\\nprinciple. It indicates that participants were more conﬁdent in\\nanswering questions related to these two ethical principles. On\\nthe other hand, questions related to‘accountability’had the\\nleast number of ‘ideal’ answers, i.e. 27.34%.\\nFurthermore, the results show that questions related to\\n‘fairness’had the highest number of ‘least desirable’ answers,\\ni.e. 28.5% followed by ‘privacy’ with 25.33%. Questions\\nrelated to the‘human, societal and environmental well-being’\\nhad the lowest percentage of ‘least desirable’ responses with\\n20.67%. Figure 3 shows the percentage of all responses based\\non ethical principles.\\nFig. 3. Percentage of all responses based on ethical principles\\n3) Results based on quiz questions:Results show that a\\nquestion (Q4) had the most ‘ideal’ answers (50%), followed\\nby two questions(Q8 and Q10)with 42% each. Furthermore,\\nQ5 had the highest percentage of ‘less than ideal’ answers\\nwith 44% followed byQ2 with 38%.\\nIn addition, results show thatQ3 had the highest percentage\\nof the ‘bearable’ answers, i.e. 36% whereas,Q1 had the\\nhighest percentage of the ‘least desirable’ answers, i.e. 66%\\nfollowed byQ9 with 44%.Q8 had the lowest ‘least desirable’\\nanswers, i.e. only 12%, which indicates that most of the partic-\\nipants were conﬁdent in answering it.

Reﬁnement\\nAfter evaluating it with students, we made minor reﬁne-\\nments to the back end, such as collecting the date and time the\\nquiz was taken and including an option to select the user type\\nat the beginning of the quiz: AI student, AI practitioner, AI\\nresearcher, Working in AI Domain, and other. This was done\\nin preparation for making the quiz available beyond students,\\nAI practitioners, and others as a next step. Ethics approval\\nfor the same has been also sought. We plan to make the quiz\\nwidely available in the industry and to the general public, and\\nassess how the ﬁndings vary by user type.\\nV. IMPLICA TIONS FORPRACTICE\\nOur ethical AI quiz allows AI practitioners to consider\\nscenario-based questions and select an answer from four an-\\nswer options. As a result, they can self-assess their knowledge\\nand understanding of AI ethics and ethical principles and better\\nunderstand ethical requirements.\\nThe experience of taking the quiz, and the feedback it\\nprovides, will help AI practitioners understand the gap areas,\\ndebate and discuss ethical AI principles and issues together,\\nand improve their overall ethical practice in everyday devel-\\nopment scenarios.\\nVI.
